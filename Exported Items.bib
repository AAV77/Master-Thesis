	abstract = {As the ﬁrst decentralized digital currency introduced in 2009 together with the blockchain, Bitcoin oﬀers new opportunities both for developed and developing countries. Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the banking system, thus facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees such as remittances, with a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities together with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and made its price skyrocket during 2017.},
